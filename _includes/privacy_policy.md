## Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. At Goal Line Apps we have a few fundamental principles:


* We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
* We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
* We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.


Goal Line Apps makes available services included in our web sites, our Apps, our blog, our API, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Goal Line Apps in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is Goal Line Apps' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Service.

Goal Line Apps does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Goal Line Apps discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Goal Line Apps' behalf or to provide services available at Goal Line Apps' Site websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Goal Line Apps will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Goal Line Apps discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Goal Line Apps believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Goal Line Apps, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Goal Line Apps may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Goal Line Apps and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Goal Line Apps takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. Goal Line Apps uses cookies to help Goal Line Apps identify and track visitors, their usage of Goal Line Apps Service, and their Service access preferences. Goal Line Apps visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Goal Line Apps' websites, with the drawback that certain features of Goal Line Apps' websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## HealthKit
Our Apps can optionally integrate with Apple's HealthKit to save off data to your local health database. If HealthKit is enabled for our Apps this health data will be saved locally and in the health store, but will not be stored online in any way or shared with any other third-party services.

## Business Transfers
If Goal Line Apps, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Goal Line Apps goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Goal Line Apps may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Data Storage
Goal Line Apps uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

## Children
We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 and do not target our websites to children under 13. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any data through the Service.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children to never provide personal data through any of our app or site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our servers.

## Exclusions
This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

## Disclaimer
While we continue to work hard to protect your data, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Consumed by Code. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Goal Line Apps may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Goal Line Apps' sole discretion. Goal Line Apps encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
