    <div class="col-sm-6">Out of the box Goal Length tracks ten different measurements, the same ten measurements I use to track my own body. If these measurements don’t appeal to you, rename them to something else, or turn them off to stop tracking them. Need to track more than ten measurements, Goal Length has you covered with the ability to track ten more measurements, for a total of twenty trackable measurements.</div>

    <div class="col-sm-6">I used to have body measurements everywhere…multiple apps, notebooks, and Excel worksheets, nothing worked the way I expected it to. Goal Length solved my body measurement needs, but by moving to a new app I didn’t want to lose all of my old history.  Goal Length makes it easy to import your old measurements into Goal Length so you can keep all of your historical measurements in one place. Click the ‘+’ in the upper right hand corner of the ‘History’ screen, set the date of the measurement, and start importing your old measurements.</div>

{% section_title Protect Your Measurements %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">I hate handing my phone over to someone and they ask, “Hey what is this Goal Length App?”, they proceed to open it up, and to my chagrin all of my body measurements are splashed all over the screen.

To combat this embarrassment I’ve added an extra layer of protection to Goal Length, under ‘Settings’ click on the ‘Touch ID / Passcode’ to protect Goal Length from prying eyes. Now anytime someone attempts to open Goal Length they will be challenged with providing authentication via Touch ID or the phone’s passcode.</div>
