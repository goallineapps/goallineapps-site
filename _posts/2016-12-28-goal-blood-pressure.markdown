{% section_title Protect Your Measurements %}
<div class="row">
I hate handing my phone over to someone and they ask, “Hey what is this Goal Blood Pressure App?”, they proceed to open it up, and to my chagrin all of my blood Pressure measurements are splashed all over the screen.

To combat this embarrassment I’ve added an extra layer of protection to Goal Blood Pressure, under ‘Settings’ click on the ‘Touch ID / Passcode’ to protect Goal Weight from prying eyes. Now anytime someone attempts to open Goal Blood Pressure they will be challenged with providing authentication via Touch ID or the phone’s passcode.
